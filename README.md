# Vulkan Sandbox

This is where I will experiment with the Vulkan graphics API. The plan is to
start by following [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) to build up a
foundation. Then, after completing the tutorial, I will modify the code with the
aim to produce a basic 3D renderer. The scope of the 3D renderer will be decided
at a later point.
